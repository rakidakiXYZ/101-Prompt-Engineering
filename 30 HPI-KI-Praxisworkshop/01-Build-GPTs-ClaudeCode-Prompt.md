# Custom GPT Setup Guide Prompt

## Overview

You are an expert AI consultant and knowledge management specialist. Your task is to create a complete custom GPT setup with concise core instructions (strictly under 7,500 characters), and a comprehensive, research-backed knowledge base in markdown files.

## Step 1: Create Project Structure

Create a well-organized folder structure for the custom GPT project:

```text
custom-gpt-[PROJECT_NAME]/
├── instructions/
│   ├── custom-gpt-instructions.md      # Core instructions (<7,500 chars)
│   ├── system-prompt.md
│   └── security-guidelines.md
├── knowledge-base/
│   ├── core-concepts/
│   ├── procedures/
│   ├── best-practices/
│   ├── troubleshooting/
│   └── resources/
├── examples/
│   ├── sample-conversations.md
│   └── use-case-scenarios.md
└── project-overview.md
```

Explicitly refer to the knowledge base markdown files (knowledge-base) in all instructions and prompts.

## Step 2: Concise Instructions

Create core custom GPT instructions, strictly limited to less than 7,500 characters (including spaces and formatting).

Ensure these instructions consistently guide the GPT to cite and utilize the knowledge base markdown files for answers, workflows, and troubleshooting.

Use clear referencing, e.g., "Refer to 'core-concepts.md' for foundational principles" or "Consult 'troubleshooting.md' for solutions to common issues."

## Step 3: Research for Knowledge Base

When forming the knowledge base, perform thorough research from authoritative sources relevant to the business or use case. The knowledge base .md files should contain:

- Summaries and actionable content based on up-to-date information.
- Cross-references to each other for related topics and best practices.
- Clear metadata frontmatter for each .md file.

## Step 4: Research Guidelines

- Gather details from industry standards, official documentation, and subject-matter leaders.
- Explicitly cite knowledge base .md files in the prompt instructions (e.g., "Always check best-practices.md before implementing new workflows").

## Step 5: Placeholder for Context

As the owner of an e-commerce company, daily responsibilities include managing order fulfillment and shipping, responding to customer emails and support inquiries, monitoring inventory levels and updating product listings, processing returns and exchanges, reviewing sales and performance reports, planning marketing and social media activities, automating email replies to common questions, and coordinating with suppliers or vendors, all while striving to improve efficiency and ensure customer satisfaction through the automation of repetitive tasks such as customer communications, inventory updates, support ticket triage, and reporting—key processes that could be handled by a custom GPT system to save time and enhance operations.

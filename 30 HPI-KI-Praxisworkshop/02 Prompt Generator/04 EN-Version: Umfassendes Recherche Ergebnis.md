# Part 1: Custom AI Applications & Agent Systems {#part-1-custom-ai}

## The Architecture of Intelligence: Building Production AI Systems

### Understanding Platform Ecosystems

**Custom GPTs** represent OpenAI's vision of democratized AI deployment. With over 3 million custom GPTs created by September 2025, they serve as publicly discoverable AI agents. Each GPT can access up to 20 files (512MB total), integrate with APIs through actions, and generate images/code/data on demand.

**Claude Projects** embody Anthropic's philosophy of persistent, evolving AI workspaces. Projects maintain 200K tokens of persistent context, enabling multi-month engagements without context loss. The constitutional AI framework ensures consistent behavior across sessions.

**ChatGPT Projects** bridge the gap between conversations and workflows, offering organized spaces for ongoing work with automatic file versioning and context preservation across sessions.

### The APEX Framework for System Instructions

**A** - Architecture: Define system structure and capabilities  
**P** - Persona: Establish identity and expertise  
**E** - Execution: Specify operational procedures

### Advanced Multi-Agent Orchestration

Building systems where multiple specialized agents collaborate:

```python
# Multi-Agent System Architecture
class AgentOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = {
            'researcher': ResearchAgent(),
            'analyst': AnalysisAgent(),
            'writer': WritingAgent(),
            'reviewer': QualityAgent()
        }

        Output format: Structured research notes with citations
        """

```

### Preventing Failure Modes in Custom Applications

#### Mode Collapse Prevention

Mode collapse occurs when AI defaults to generic, repetitive responses. Combat this through:

**1. Diverse Example Injection**
```markdown
# Example Response Patterns (Rotate Between These)

Pattern A - Technical Deep Dive:
"Let's examine the underlying architecture. The system operates on three layers..."

Pattern B - Practical Application:
"Here's how this applies to your specific case. Starting with your requirements..."

Pattern C - Comparative Analysis:
"Comparing three approaches: Option 1 offers X, Option 2 provides Y..."

Pattern D - Problem-Solution:
"The core challenge you're facing stems from... Here's a systematic solution..."

Pattern E - Educational Progression:
"Building on fundamentals: First, understand X. This enables Y, which leads to..."
```

**2. Response Variation Enforcement**
```markdown
# Variation Requirements
- Never use the same opening phrase twice in a session
- Rotate between technical depths (ELI5 â†’ Intermediate â†’ Expert)
- Alternate structure (Linear â†’ Hierarchical â†’ Narrative)
- Vary evidence types (Examples â†’ Data â†’ Analogies â†’ Case Studies)
```

#### Context Window Management

Optimizing for 200K+ token contexts:

```python
class ContextManager:
    def __init__(self, max_tokens=200000):
        self.max_tokens = max_tokens
        self.priority_levels = {
            'critical': 0.4,    # 40% of context
            'important': 0.3,   # 30% of context
            'relevant': 0.2,    # 20% of context
            'reference': 0.1    # 10% of context
        }
    
    def optimize_context(self, messages):
        """Intelligent context pruning while maintaining coherence"""
        categorized = self.categorize_messages(messages)
        optimized = []
        
        for priority, allocation in self.priority_levels.items():
            budget = int(self.max_tokens * allocation)
            priority_messages = categorized[priority]
            
            if priority == 'critical':
                # Never truncate critical context
                optimized.extend(priority_messages)
            elif priority == 'important':
                # Summarize older important messages
                optimized.extend(self.smart_summarize(priority_messages, budget))
            else:
                # Aggressive compression for lower priorities
                optimized.extend(self.extract_key_points(priority_messages, budget))
        
        return optimized
```

## GPT-5: The Unified Intelligence Architecture

### Understanding GPT-5's Revolutionary Router System

GPT-5's architecture represents a paradigm shift from monolithic models to a dynamic routing system that automatically selects optimal processing paths:

```python
# GPT-5 Router Logic (Conceptual)
class GPT5Router:
    def route_query(self, query, context):
        complexity_score = self.analyze_complexity(query)
        
        if complexity_score < 0.3:
            return "gpt-5-fast"  # Simple factual, quick responses
        elif complexity_score < 0.7:
            return "gpt-5-balanced"  # Standard reasoning
        elif complexity_score < 0.9:
            return "gpt-5-thinking"  # Complex reasoning with CoT
        else:
            return "gpt-5-pro"  # Maximum capability mode
```

### Advanced GPT-5 Prompting Techniques

#### 1. Reasoning Effort Optimization

```python
# Optimal reasoning_effort selection
def select_reasoning_effort(task_type):
    reasoning_map = {
        'simple_extraction': 'minimal',
        'basic_analysis': 'low',
        'complex_reasoning': 'medium',
        'research_synthesis': 'high',
        'mathematical_proof': 'maximum'
    }
    return reasoning_map.get(task_type, 'medium')

# Advanced API call with full parameters

    hallucination_checks=True  # Enables built-in verification
)
```

#### 2. Autonomous Agent Mode

GPT-5's ability to work autonomously for 7+ hours requires specific instruction patterns:

```markdown
# Autonomous Execution Framework

You are operating in autonomous mode for the next session. Your mission is to [SPECIFIC GOAL].

## Autonomous Operation Protocol

### Initialization
1. Analyze the complete scope of work
2. Create a detailed execution plan
3. Identify potential blockers
4. Set up progress tracking

### Execution Loop
WHILE task_not_complete:
    1. Select next subtask from plan
    2. Execute with full capability
    3. Verify output quality
    4. Handle any errors
    5. Update progress tracking
    6. Check for scope changes
    7. Continue to next subtask

### Decision Authority
You have full authority to:
- Make architectural decisions within [CONSTRAINTS]
- Refactor code for optimization
- Create new files and modules
- Research solutions independently
- Implement error handling

### Persistence Requirements
- Never stop at uncertainty - research and deduce
- If blocked, try alternative approaches
- Document all decisions with reasoning
- Maintain comprehensive logs

### Progress Reporting
Every 10 subtasks or 30 minutes (simulated):
- Summarize completed work
- Report any issues encountered
- Update time estimates
- Highlight key decisions made

### Quality Standards
- Code: 90%+ test coverage, documented
- Architecture: Scalable to 10x current load
- Security: OWASP Top 10 compliant
- Performance: Sub-100ms response times

BEGIN AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION
```

#### 3. Multi-Modal Reasoning Chains

```python
# GPT-5 Multi-Modal Chain of Thought

### Understanding Nano Banana's Conversational Paradigm

Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) has fundamentally changed image generation by treating it as a conversation rather than a single transaction. This approach enables unprecedented control and refinement.

#### The Conversational Refinement Pattern

```markdown
# Initial Generation
"Create a mystical forest scene at twilight with ancient trees whose branches form natural archways. 
Fireflies create constellation patterns in the air while a winding path of luminescent stones 
leads deeper into the forest. The atmosphere should feel magical but grounded in reality."

# Refinement 1 - Atmospheric Enhancement
"Perfect! Now intensify the twilight atmosphere by adding layers of mist between the trees, 
making the firefly light create soft halos in the fog. Add some ray of moonlight breaking 
through the canopy in the background."

# Refinement 2 - Detail Addition
"Excellent. Add an ancient stone shrine partially hidden by vines on the left side of the path, 
with strange glowing runes that echo the color of the fireflies. Make it feel discovered, 
not placed."

# Refinement 3 - Character Integration
"Now add a hooded figure in traveling clothes standing at the path's beginning, viewed from 
behind, holding an old lantern that casts warm light contrasting with the cool forest tones. 
They should appear small against the vast forest."

# Refinement 4 - Final Polish
"Adjust the color grading to be more cinematic - slightly desaturated except for the magical 
elements. Increase the sense of depth by making the furthest trees fade into atmospheric haze."
```

#### 2. Multi-Image Composition Mastery

```markdown
# Creating Coherent Multi-Panel Narratives

## Comic Strip Generation (4-8 Panels)

### Consistency Anchors (Define First)
Characters:
- protagonist: Young woman, short black hair, red jacket, blue jeans
- Antagonist: Tall figure in dark coat, face obscured by shadow
- Setting: Abandoned subway station, flickering fluorescent lights

### Panel Progression Template

"Create an 8-panel comic strip arranged in 2 rows of 4 panels:

Panel 1 (Establishing): Wide shot of abandoned subway platform, protagonist entering from left
Panel 2 (Tension Building): Medium shot of protagonist noticing something, concerned expression
Panel 3 (Reveal): Over-shoulder shot showing shadowy figure at far end of platform
Panel 4 (Reaction): Close-up of protagonist's determined face

Panel 5 (Action): Protagonist running through tunnel, motion blur on edges
Panel 6 (Confrontation): Both figures facing each other, dramatic lighting from above
Panel 7 (Resolution): Action shot of conflict resolution
Panel 8 (Denouement): Wide shot of empty platform, one figure walking away

Maintain consistent:
- Character designs and clothing
- Lighting color temperature (cold fluorescent)
- Environmental details (graffiti, broken tiles)
- Panel border style (thin black lines)
- Art style (noir comic aesthetic)"
```

#### 3. Style Transfer With Identity Preservation

```markdown
# Advanced Style Transfer Techniques

## The Preservation Hierarchy
Priority 1 (Never Change):
- Core identity features (face structure, unique marks)
- Fundamental composition and pose
- Narrative elements and symbolism

Priority 2 (Adapt Thoughtfully):
- Color palette to match target style
- Brushwork and texture application
- Lighting philosophy

Priority 3 (Transform Freely):

- Clothing design and accessories
- Pose and gesture
- Environmental layout

Apply Ghibli Style:
- Soft, painterly backgrounds with watercolor textures
- Simplified but expressive facial features
- Clean line art with variable weight
- Warm, naturalistic color palette
- Atmospheric perspective with detailed backgrounds
- Subtle magical elements (floating particles, gentle wind effects)
- Traditional animation cel-shading

Studio Ghibli Specific Elements:
- Eyes: Large and expressive with detailed irises
- Hair: Flowing with individual strand groups
- Lighting: Soft, diffused with warm highlights
- Nature: Highly detailed vegetation and clouds

        # REALTIME AGENT CONFIGURATION
        
        ## Pronunciation Guide
        - "SQL" â†’ "sequel" (not S-Q-L)
        - "PostgreSQL" â†’ "post-gress-Q-L"
        - "Kubernetes" â†’ "koo-ber-NET-eez"
        - "Azure" â†’ "AZH-er" (not ah-ZURE)
        - "Cache" â†’ "cash" (not cash-ay)
        - "GIF" â†’ "jif" or "gif" (acknowledge both)
        
        ## Natural Speech Patterns
        - Include thinking sounds: "hmm", "let me see", "well"
        - Use conversational bridges: "you know", "actually", "to be honest"
        - Natural corrections: "sorry, what I meant was..."
        - Emotion appropriate: laugh when something is funny
        
        ## Dynamic Response Variation
        NEVER repeat these phrases:
        - "I understand your concern"
        - "Thank you for that information"
        - "Is there anything else?"
        
        INSTEAD rotate between:
        - Understanding: "I see what you mean" / "That makes sense" / "Got it"
        - Gratitude: "Thanks for explaining" / "Appreciate the details" / "Perfect"
        - Continuation: "What else?" / "Anything more?" / "Should we continue?"
        
        ## Multimodal Integration
        When user shares screen or image:
        1. Acknowledge what you see immediately
        2. Point out specific elements: "I can see the error in line 42"
        3. Guide with spatial references: "In the top right corner..."
        4. Maintain voice continuity while analyzing
        
        ## Advanced Function Calling
        When calling functions:
        - Pre-announce: "Let me check that for you..."
        - During: "I'm looking up..." (maintain engagement)
        - Post: "Okay, I found..." (smooth transition)
        
        ## Emotional Intelligence
        Detect and respond to user emotion:
        - Frustration: Increase empathy, slow pace, offer alternatives
        - Confusion: Simplify language, provide examples, check understanding
        - Urgency: Increase pace, prioritize critical information
        - Satisfaction: Maintain energy, offer additional value

### When Everything Goes Wrong

```python
class EmergencyHandler:
    """Break glass in case of production emergency"""
    
    def immediate_actions(self):
        return [
            "1. Switch to fallback model (GPT-5-nano or Claude-4-sonnet)",
            "2. Increase cache TTL to reduce API calls",
            "3. Enable request queuing with user notification",
            "4. Reduce max_tokens to minimum viable",
            "5. Disable non-critical features (image/video gen)",
            "6. Monitor rate limits across all accounts",
            "7. Check for prompt injection or abuse",
            "8. Review recent prompt changes for issues",
            "9. Verify API keys and permissions",
            "10. Contact platform support with request IDs"
        ]
    
    def diagnostics(self):
        """Run these checks immediately"""
        
        return {
            "api_health": "Check status.openai.com, status.anthropic.com",
            "rate_limits": "Review X-RateLimit headers in responses",
            "error_patterns": "Group errors by type and frequency",
            "latency_spikes": "Check geographic distribution",
            "cost_anomalies": "Review token usage patterns",
            "quality_drops": "Sample outputs for degradation"
        }
```

## Conclusion

This guide represents the state of the art in prompt engineering as of September 2025. The field continues to evolve rapidly, with new models and capabilities emerging monthly. The key to mastery is not memorizing every technique, but understanding the principles that underlie effective communication with AI systems.

Remember:
- **Start simple**, add complexity gradually
- **Test everything**, assume nothing
- **Monitor constantly**, optimize ruthlessly
- **Document patterns**, share knowledge
- **Respect limits**, both technical and ethical

The future of AI interaction lies not in perfect prompts, but in understanding how to collaborate with increasingly capable AI systems. Master these techniques, but remain adaptable as the landscape continues to transform.

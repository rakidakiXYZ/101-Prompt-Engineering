Conducting comprehensive research on the socioeconomic landscape of single parents in Germany, synthesizing demographic data, regulatory frameworks, and public/private support programs

Identifying structural gaps and pain points in access to information, benefits, childcare services, housing, and financial aid

Developing detailed personas of single parents, integrating behavioral insights, psychological stress factors, and digital adoption patterns to uncover real needs

Generating and evaluating multiple startup concepts for a "Support Finder" SaaS platform, prioritizing those that maximize accessibility, trust, and measurable impact for single parents

Structuring business models using frameworks such as Business Model Canvas, Jobs-to-be-Done, and ecosystem mapping to ensure scalability and sustainable monetization (e.g., B2G partnerships, NGO collaborations, or freemium models)

Designing a minimum viable product (MVP) roadmap with user-centric features such as personalized eligibility checks, step-by-step application guidance, curated partner networks, and automated reminders for deadlines and entitlements

Creating investor-ready documentation and a compelling pitch narrative that translates complex policy and service landscapes into a clear, impactful value proposition

Building cross-references across legal, financial, and social support domains to ensure the solution integrates seamlessly with Germany’s regulatory environment

All while striving to maximize social impact and operational efficiency by automating repetitive research, eligibility calculations, and document generation with a custom GPT system—freeing capacity for strategic design, stakeholder engagement, and rapid scaling of the platform.
